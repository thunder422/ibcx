IBCX v0.0.2 Release Notes
=========================

This release of the IBCX consists of a core library for compiling,
recreating and executing BASIC programs.  The library is intended to be
used by applications, for example, the included IBC executable, a
standalone compiler that will also execute the BASIC program once
compiled if there are not errors.

This release has been tested on Linux Mint 13, Windows 10 and Windows XP
(see wiki for more details).

Major Changes
-------------

 * The code for the math operators have been moved to their own source
   file.

 * All of the math operator unit tests have been put into a single unit
   tests source file (the unit tests for each operator can still be run
   independently.

 * A few missing checks on missing or bad operands of operators have
   been added.

 * Access functions to the top of the executer stack have been added so
   that the top item on the stack is properly encapsulated.


New Language Features
---------------------

 * Comparison operators (less than, greater than, less than or equal to,
   greater than or equal to, equal to, and not equal to).
