IBCX v0.0.3 Release Notes
=========================

This release of the IBCX consists of a core library for compiling,
recreating and executing BASIC programs.  The library is intended to be
used by applications, for example, the included IBC executable, a
standalone compiler that will also execute the BASIC program once
compiled if there are not errors.

This release has been tested on Linux Mint 13, Windows 10 and Windows XP
(see wiki for more details).

New Language Features
---------------------

 * Logic operators (not, and, exclusive-or, or, equivalence, and
   implication).

 * Internal convesion to integer code added for the logic operators,
   which take only integer operands.  The execution of this code checks
   for an overflow on the double value.
